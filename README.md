# Automated Fama-French Three-Factor Model Analysis

## Project Description
This repository contains a Python script designed for financial modeling and stock performance analysis using the Fama-French three-factor model. The script automates the analysis of stock excess returns against market, size, and value factors, incorporating data cleaning, wrangling, and regression analysis to provide actionable investment insights.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning and Wrangling:** Ensures that the data fed into the model is clean and formatted correctly, enhancing the accuracy of the analysis.
- **Dynamic Stock Analysis:** Users can specify stock tickers and the date range for analysis, allowing for flexible and tailored analytical outputs.
- **Regression Analysis:** Employs the `statsmodels` library to perform regression analysis, relating stock returns to the Fama-French factors.
- **Visualization:** Generates plots to visually compare actual vs. predicted stock returns, helping in the assessment of the model's performance.
